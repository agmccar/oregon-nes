# Many kinds of people made the trip to Oregon.
#
# You may:
# 
# Be a banker from Boston
# Be a carpenter from Ohio
# Be a farmer from Illinois
# Find out the differences between these choices

# Traveling to Oregon isn't easy! But if you're a banker, you'll have more
# money for supplies and services than a carpenter or a farmer.
#
# However, the harder you have to try, the more points you deserve! 
# Therefore, the farmer earns the greatest number of points and the banker
# earns the least.

# Going back to 1848...

# It is 1848. Your jumping off place for Oregon is Independence, Missouri.
# You must decide which month to leave Independence.
#
# March
# April
# May
# June
# July
# Ask for advice

# You attend a public meeting held for "folks with the California - Oregon
# fever." You're told:
#
# If you leave too early, there won't be any grass for your oxen to eat. If
# you leave too late, you may not get to Oregon before winter comes. If you
# leave at just the right time, there will be green grass and the weather
# will still be cool.
# PSB

# Before leaving Independence, you should buy equipment and supplies.
# You have $$$$$$ in cash, but you don't have to spend it all now.

# You can buy whatever you need at Matt's General Store.
