Try taking a journey by covered wagon across 2000 miles of plains, rivers,
and mountains. Try! On the plains, will you slosh your oxen through mud and
water-filled ruts or will you plop through dust six inches deep?

How will you cross the rivers? If you have money, you might take a ferry (if
there is a ferry.) Or, you can ford the river and hope you and your wagon
aren't swallowed alive!

What about supplies? Well, if you're low on food you can hunt. You might get
a buffalo...you might. And there are bear in the mountains.

At the Dalles, you can try navigating the Columbia River, but if running the
rapids with a makeshift raft makes you queasy, better take the Barlow Road.

If for some reason you don't survive -- your wagon burns, or thieves steal
your oxen, or you run out of provisions, or you die of cholera -- don't give
up! Try again...and again...until your name is up with the others on The
Oregon Top Ten.
