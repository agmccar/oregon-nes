To ford a river means to pull your wagon across a shallow part of the river,
with the oxen still attached.

To caulk the wagon means to seal it so that no water can get in. The wagon
can then be floated across like a boat.

To use a ferry means to put your wagon on top of a flat boat that belongs
to someone else. The owner of the ferry will take your wagon across the river.
