On Arriving In Oregon

#############

Your most important resource is the people you have with you. You receive
points for each member of your party who arrives safely; you receive more
points if they arrive in good health!

Health of Party   Points per Person
good              500
fair              400
poor              300
very poor         200

#############

The resources you arrive with will help you get started in the new land.
You receive points for each item you bring safely to Oregon.

Resources of Party      Points per Item
wagons                  50
ox                      4
spare wagon part        2
set of clothing         2
bullets (each 50)       1
food (each 25 pounds)   1
cash (each 5 dollars)   1

#############

You receive points for your occupation in the new land. Because more farmers
and carpenters were needed than bankers, you receive double points upon
arriving in Oregon as a carpenter, and triple points for arriving as a farmer.
